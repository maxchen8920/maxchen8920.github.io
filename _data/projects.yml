- name: Hybrid Movie Recommender
  descr: "This movie recommender combines collaborative filtering and content-based filtering techniques to produce movie recommendations for a specific movie. It accounts for user ratings, genres and tags. Testing shows that the recommender performs quite well despite a relatively small dataset (https://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/)."

- name: Exploration of Heteroscedasticity in GarageArea for Housing-Prices
  descr: "This project is an analysis of heteroscedasticity in a housing prices dataset (https://www.kaggle.com/c/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques), and techniques for removing heteroscedasticity."

- name: ResNet-18 Implementation from Scratch
  descr: "This project is a custom implementation of convolutional neural network 'ResNet-18'. This was coded for the use in a image classification task with a small dataset and small images, as ResNet-18 provided a deep enough neural network for image classification, but the low image complexity didn't require a neural network that was too deep such as ResNet-50. This was used in conjunction with image pre-processing such as flipping, rotation, RandomPerspective and ColorJitter."
